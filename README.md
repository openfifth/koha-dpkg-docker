Automated Debian package builder for Koha, based on the work by tcohen

This is designed to run within Jenkins or GitLab CI/CD, as a quick, easy, and reliable way of turning a Koha repository clone into a Debian package of Koha.

## Usage
You will need three things to build a Koha package:
* a valid Koha repository (in this example, it will be at `/home/koha/kohaclone`)
* a valid, empty, output directory (in this example, it will be at `/home/koha/kohadebs`)
* a valid installation of Docker (please see the [Installing Docker correctly](https://gitlab.com/ptfs-europe/koha-debs-docker/-/wikis/Installing%20Docker%20correctly) article for instructions on how to do this)

Make sure you have checked out the branch you would like. To do this (using master as an example):
```bash
cd /home/koha/kohaclone
git fetch origin ; git checkout -b master.custom --track origin/master
```

With the correct branch, choose a valid Docker image, and run with:
```bash
docker run \
    --privileged \
    --volume=/home/koha/kohaclone:/kohaclone \
    --volume=/home/koha/kohadebs:/kohadebs \
    ptfseurope/koha-dpkg-docker:master
```

Remember to keep the Docker mountpoints (the directory after the colon) the same! When the process is complete, you should have a valid set of packages in the `kohadebs` directory.

Congratulations!
